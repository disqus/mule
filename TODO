General:

- Build a JSONTestRunner

- run_test would be awesome if it expected a JSON result from the test runner (or at least our runners gave it that)
  we could then store additional data like "I did this as part of the build" including timing/profiling data

Django Integration:

- There seems to be a race condition still with getting database locks and we get a "cannot create database, already exists"

- The short version of app names doesnt work currently. e.g. forums.TestCase
