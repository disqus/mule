General:

- Build a JSONTestRunner

- run_test would be awesome if it expected a JSON result from the test runner (or at least our runners gave it that)
  we could then store additional data like "I did this as part of the build" including timing/profiling data
  
  otherwise we have to hack up xunit :(

- mule.process should support async callbacks so that results could be reported a lot quicker, and in smaller
  portions (otherwise the master isnt doing much work until the end, when its bulk work).

- The Django test suite runner should be mostly a mixin class so that we can reuse the core of it as a generic unittest/2
  suite runner.
  
- mule_teardown needs to ensure it wipes ALL jobs in the current queue

Django Integration:

- The short version of app names doesnt work currently. e.g. forums.TestCase

- Implement support for --failfast under distributed models

- Text runner output doesnt support verbosity levels correctly (for non-errors/failures):

  (Should it?)

  if self.showAll:
      self.stream.writeln('%s (%.3fs)' % \
          (verbose_str, test_info.get_elapsed_time()))

- The Disqus selenium test should have been reported as skipped, but wasn't. It caused metric tons of timeouts and consumed way too
  much cpu time.
