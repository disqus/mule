Django Integration:

- TransactionTestCase should be ordered last, and they need to completely tear down
  all data in all tables and re-run syncdb (initial fixtures) each time.
  This same (bad) behavior needs to happen on every TestCase if not connections_support_transactions()

  (This is currently handled now by doing a 'flush' on each startup that doesnt create the db)

- Database name should create a lock. Multiple locks should be allowed which just says "if you're trying to execute
  and a lock exists, create a new database with a new lock". These should be incremental so other processes can find
  and reuse these databases.
 
- suite_result needs to correctly handle Exceptions as if they were exceptions during the test process

- There seems to be a race condition still with getting database locks and we get a "cannot create database, already exists"

- run_test should return all responses in JSON
